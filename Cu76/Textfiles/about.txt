Parameters found in the RIKEN data:

imp.x: x-value of implantation in DSSD (similar for y and z)
imp.tx: timing information for electron detection in DSSD
imp.ts: time stamp -
imp.beta35: velocity change from f3 to t5 (same for beta57 (5 to 7) and beta711 (7 to 11))
flagall = 1: good event (flagall=0 -> Bad event that cannot be used)
deltaz = 0: same DSSD level (1-8) (Can also use +/- 1 DSSD, but have to be more careful)
(Recommended to use only deltaz=0) See also Frank's thesis about deltaxy which was set to be
smaller than 2.
All files in bg: Wrong correlations, where beta decay was detected before implantation.
kMaxBeta: how many beta decays after implantation (If this is too high, you only get
0 for the ones that are too much. This is not a problem)


Notes:

Do everything for Cu-76 first
Decay time in units of time stamps: goes from 0 to 5 s (Double check velocity distribution)
Analyze first experiment number 1 and then number 2 (filename starts with 5)
and then add the two




Future plans:

Do everything for Cu-76 first

Do Gaussian fits to all Beta F7-F11 DSSDs (All 8)
-> Use this to implement conditions in all other read-files
*** Ex: if (z=8) & (min_accepted_velocity < beta711 < max_accepted_velocity), then... ***

With same conditions as in read.C in read_data/decay_time to plot the background decay times

Make decay-chain and find out which nuclei to consider (Together with Eda?)

Decay time in units of time stamps: goes from 0 to 5 s (Double check velocity distribution)

Analyze first experiment number 1 and then number 2 (filename starts with 5)
and then add the two
